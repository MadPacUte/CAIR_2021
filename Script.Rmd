### Install and Load Packages

```{r}
# Load up necessary packages up front so that if you hand this code off to a
# coworker, it will fail at the beginning of the script.

# First we will install the necessary packages

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("scales")

# There are a few options you have to load up packages. However, we will use the function (library()) to load the necessary packages.

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(scales)

# Some of our favorite packages to use within data analysis, but are not using today:
# readxl, plotly, reactable, DT, scales, tidygeocoder, here
```

### Read in data

```{r}
# Read in the first data set that will be used within the report
# We will use the function (read_csv()) from the package *readr*

data_raw <-
  readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadPacUte/CAIR_2021/main/CAIR_2021_DATA.csv")
  

# Read in the second data set that will be used within the report
# We will use the function (read_csv()) from the package *readr*

# data_raw <-
#   readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadPacUte/CAIR_2021/main/CAIR_2021_DATA_2.csv")
```


### Initial Data Cleaning

```{r}
# We can clean up the names of the columns to get them all in the same format
# We will do this by using the function (clean_names()) from the package *janitor*

data_clean <-
  data_raw %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

# The function (clean_names()) is great for cleaning up messy column names that are not structured very well

# Let's look at at the first 6 columns to compare what the column names looked like prior

data_raw %>%
  dplyr::select(1:6)

# This is what they transformed into

data_clean %>%
  dplyr::select(1:6)

# Much cleaner names, easier to read, and replaced capital letters with lowercase and _ to connect words
```

### Explore Data Types

```{r}
# Now we will look at the column types using the function (glimpse()) from the package *dplyr*

data_clean %>%
  dplyr::glimpse()

# We can see that age is a dbl, gpa is a chr.
# These data types are some of the most common ones
# Another common one is Date, which we would suggest looking into the package (lubridate)

# We can see that gpa column is classified as a character, but we want to convert it to a factor

# We can convert the variable into a factor by using the function (mutate()) from the package *dplyr*

data_clean <-
  data_clean %>%
  dplyr::mutate(gpa = factor(gpa))

# We can now see that the gpa column has now been reclassified as a factor

data_clean %>%
  dplyr::glimpse()

# Factors are classified by their ranking. Let's look at the levels of the gpa column that we just converted
# into a factor is leveled. The levels function is from base r. 

levels(data_clean$gpa)

# We can write out the levels by hand if we want them in a certain order. Let's assign an object to classify it correctly.

levels <-
  c("0.0-.4", "1.5-1.9", "2.0-2.4", "2.5-2.9", "3.0-3.4", "3.5-4.0", "> 4.0", "Unknown")

# We want to classify them into the correct order (lowest to highest) by using an argument from the function (factor())

data_clean <-
  data_clean %>%
  dplyr::mutate(gpa = factor(gpa, level = levels))

# Verify that they are now in the correct order.

levels(data_clean$gpa)
```

### Create a new summarized dataset

```{r}
# Let's go back to the original data_clean version and create a few new columns

gpa_ethnicity_year_summarized <-
  data_clean %>% # take the cleaned dataset
  extract(period, into = c("year", "semester"), "(.{4})(.{1})") %>% # create two new columns using feature engineering
  group_by(ethnicity, gpa, year) %>% # group the data by ethnicity, gpa, and year
  summarize(total = n()) %>%  # add up all of the counts by the grouping
  ungroup() %>% # remove the group by
  filter(!is.na(ethnicity), ethnicity != "Unknown", gpa != "Unknown") # filter out any missing ethnicity as well as unknown ethnicity and gpa

# The data is now listed in a tidy format to explore over the years, but if we group the data we can plot it
```


### Final Chart

```{r, out.width= "100%", out.height= "100%"}
# Set theme for better visualization
theme_set(theme_bw())

# Plot the chart

gpa_ethnicity_year_summarized %>% # take the summarized gpa, ethnicity, and year dataset
  mutate(gpa = fct_rev(gpa)) %>% # reorder the legend so the rankings are in order
  ggplot(aes(year, total, group = gpa, color = gpa)) + # initially plot the x and y coordinates and color by gpa
  geom_line(size = 1) + # create a line chart
  facet_wrap(~ethnicity, scales = "free_y", labeller = labeller(group = label_wrap_gen(width = 50))) +  # separate the ethnicity into their own charts while releasing the y axis to see differences between groups as well as ensure the names fit
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(accuracy = 1)) +  # change the y labels to have commas
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5) # adjust the x axis text to not overlap
  ) +
  labs( # update the labels within the graph
    x = "",
    y = "",
    color = "GPA",
    title = "Time Series of gpa by Ethnicity",
    subtitle = "Count of students by year"
  )
```



```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
# Archive

# There is another option to load packages that we reuse in other scripts.

# Create a logical check to see if the package *pacman* has been installed.
# If it has not been installed, then R will install it.

# if (!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")

# Then using one of the functions (p_load()) within the package *pacman* we load the packages we want to use

# pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lubridate, janitor, scales)

## You can also merge datasets together using the function (bind_rows())

# Append the data together using the function (bind_rows()) from the package (dplyr)

# data_raw <-
#   data %>%
#   dplyr::bind_rows(data_2)

# Do a quick check and ensure that the data was appended properly
# R is a great tool and has a lot of cool features, such as a calculator already built in

# 5998 + 6316

# Or you can use the function (nrow) for each dataset and add the two together

# nrow(data) + nrow(data_2)

# Double check that the two match
# (5998 + 6316) == nrow(data) + nrow(data_2)
```
